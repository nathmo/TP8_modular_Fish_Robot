  * \param address Address of the register to write to or read from.
  * \param radio_data A pointer to the data to be read/written. Data can be
  * accessed through different fields of the RadioData union, depending on the
  * operation type. Note that when handling a ROP_READ_MB operation, the user must
  * also set radio_data->multibyte.size.
  * \return TRUE if the operation was handled by the callback, FALSE otherwise.
